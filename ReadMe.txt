1. Raw behavior data is in folder 'data for figures'.Data for generating figures in figure 1, 5, 6 is stored in 'Data_final.mat'. Behavior data for generating figures in figS9 and figS10 are stored in 'SSFO_figS9_and_figS10.mat'. 

2. in 'data for figures' folder, Use  'fig1.m', 'fig5.m', 'fig6.m' and 'figS9_and-figS10.m' to compute the parameters we presented in figure 1, 5, 6, S9 and S10. Plots and statistics were done in  'behaviordata_Fig_1_3_6_S9_S10.prism'.
